# AirBnB_clone
a Basic AirBnB clone project.

## The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

we won't implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:

<ul>
<li>A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)</li>
<li>A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic</li>
<li>A database or files that store data (data = objects)</li>
<li>An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)</li>
</ul>
